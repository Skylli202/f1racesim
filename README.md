## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
## Test

Tests are important in a modern project. When struggling with tests, please refer to this awesome work from [davipon](https://github.com/davipon).

> Currently there is no E2E test, only unit test are currently planned to be implemented.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
